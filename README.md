# Amberstar.net
Remake of the Amiga classic Amberstar


For this early development I keep the Amberstar projects in the repo where I also implement the new engine.

You can find everything at https://github.com/Pyrdacor/Amber for now.

But I will already use the issue tracker here for ideas and feature suggestions.
